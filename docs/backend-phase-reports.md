# Backend phase reports

## B0 — reconnaissance

Read the complete Phase 2 brief, Phase 1 ports/contracts, architecture and traceability. Enumerated both MCP servers and inspected n8n workflows, preferences, credential inventory and node catalog. Verified n8n version, health, public API authentication, credential schemas and installed PATCH controller. No hosted Supabase project was modified.

Baseline gates: typecheck, lint, 29 unit tests, production build, design audit, 26 contrast pairs all pass. Supabase local availability and container-to-host probes depend on B1 startup. Credential write probe follows local key provisioning. Dataset downloads and corpus-level validation belong to B4, and are not claimed complete here. Deviations and sources: ADR 002.
